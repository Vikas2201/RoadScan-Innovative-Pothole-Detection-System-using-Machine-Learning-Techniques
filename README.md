# RoadScan Innovative Pothole Detection System using Machine Learning Techniques
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RoadScan is an innovative pothole detection system that utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to detect potholes on roads. The system is designed to improve road safety by identifying and detecting potholes before they become a hazard to motorists. RoadScan uses a combination of image processing algorithms and machine learning algorithms to analyze road surface images and accurately identify potholes. The system is equipped with high-quality cameras that capture images of the road surface, which are then processed and analyzed in real-time using machine learning algorithms. RoadScan is capable of detecting potholes of various shapes and sizes, including those that are not visible to the naked eye. The system can also accurately classify the severity of each pothole, enabling road maintenance teams to prioritize repairs based on the level of urgency. RoadScan is a cost-effective and efficient solution that can be easily installed on any vehicle or mobile platform, making it ideal for use by road maintenance teams and government agencies. Overall, RoadScan is a valuable tool for ensuring road safety and maintaining the integrity of road infrastructure.

# Technology Used
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As RoadScan pothole detection system uses machine learning techniques, several Python libraries are used for implementing the system. Some of the commonly used libraries are:

 * OpenCV: It is an open-source library that is used for computer vision applications. In RoadScan, it is used for image processing and feature extraction from images.

 * NumPy: It is a numerical computing library that is used for working with arrays and matrices. It is used in RoadScan for handling image data and performing matrix operations.

 * Pandas: It is a data manipulation library that is used for data analysis and cleaning. It is used in RoadScan for organizing and analyzing the data obtained from the sensors.

 * Matplotlib: It is a plotting library that is used for data visualization. In RoadScan, it is used for visualizing the sensor data and the results obtained from the machine learning algorithms.

 * Scikit-learn: It is a machine learning library that provides various algorithms and tools for building machine learning models. It is used in RoadScan for building the pothole detection model using classification algorithms such as SVM, KNN, and CNN.

 * TensorFlow: It is an open-source machine learning library that is used for building and training deep learning models. It is used in RoadScan for building the CNN model for pothole detection.

 * Keras: It is a high-level neural networks API that is used for building and training deep learning models. It is used in RoadScan for building the CNN model and optimizing it using ADAM optimizer.
 
 * OS: It is used for creating and deleting folders.
 
 * Flask: A lightweight web framework that can be used to create web-based user interfaces for the RoadScan system. It is designed to be easy to use and can be customized with a variety of third-party plugins and extensions.
 
 * SQLite: SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. It is a serverless database that requires no configuration and stores data in a single file for RoadScan System.
 
 * Front End Deployment: It is done using HTML , CSS , and Bootstrapping.

These libraries provide a range of functionalities and tools that are essential for building and implementing the RoadScan pothole detection system.
