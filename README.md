# RoadScan Innovative Pothole Detection System using Machine Learning Techniques
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RoadScan is an innovative pothole detection system that utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to detect potholes on roads. The system is designed to improve road safety by identifying and detecting potholes before they become a hazard to motorists. RoadScan uses a combination of image processing algorithms and machine learning algorithms to analyze road surface images and accurately identify potholes. The system is equipped with high-quality cameras that capture images of the road surface, which are then processed and analyzed in real-time using machine learning algorithms. RoadScan is capable of detecting potholes of various shapes and sizes, including those that are not visible to the naked eye. The system can also accurately classify the severity of each pothole, enabling road maintenance teams to prioritize repairs based on the level of urgency. RoadScan is a cost-effective and efficient solution that can be easily installed on any vehicle or mobile platform, making it ideal for use by road maintenance teams and government agencies. Overall, RoadScan is a valuable tool for ensuring road safety and maintaining the integrity of road infrastructure.
